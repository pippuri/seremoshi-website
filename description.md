This project is using Clerk for authentication. The service is an AI powered phone exchange - a virtual receptionist that screens calls on behalf of the end user.

The user can publish a phone number for commercial proposals without exposing their personal number. The service listens to the sales pitch, asks clarifying questions, and then compares notes with the user preferences. Then it makes a decision whether to connect the caller through to the customer.
